                          \b chicken and chorizo in the pan. Add pimentÃ³n, bay leaves, garlic, tomatoes, onion,
                          \b salt and pepper, and cook, stirring often until thickened and fragrant, about 10
                          \b minutes. Add saffron broth and remaining 4 1/2 cups chicken broth; bring to a boil.

                          \b to medium-low, add reserved shrimp and mussels, tucking them down into the rice, and
                          \b cook again without stirring, until mussels have opened and rice is just tender, 5 to 7
